Code to solve the following question

16a. Suppose the run-time of a serial program is given by Tserial = n2, where the units of the run-time are in microseconds. Suppose that a parallelization of this program has run-time Tparallel = n2/p + log2(p). Write a program that finds the speedups and efficiencies of this program for various values of n and p. Run your program with n = 10, 20, 40, . . . , 320, and p = 1, 2, 4, . . . , 128. What happens to the speedups and efficiencies as p is increased and n is held fixed? What happens when p is fixed and n is increased?
